The proposed project aims to revolutionize urban wind energy production by installing Bladeless Wind Turbines (BWTs) integrated with a microgrid system at Northeastern University. 
The BWTs, known for their compact design and efficiency, will harness wind energy in urban settings, addressing the challenges faced by conventional turbines. The energy produced 
will power Northeastern's EXP building, demonstrating the feasibility of this innovative approach.

The project unfolds in phases, encompassing project commencement, data analysis, equipment deployment, software development, testing, and closure. The budget of $657,539 covers 
labor, materials, and contingencies. The primary goal is to validate the potential of BWTs in urban environments, utilizing microgrids for energy storage and distribution.

The urban wind energy problem in Boston, where wind energy constitutes only 1-3% of total generation, underscores the need for alternative solutions. BWTs offer a compact, 
efficient, and visually appealing answer, showcasing higher efficiency at lower wind speeds compared to traditional turbines. The project's unique approach positions 
Northeastern University as a proof of concept, paving the way for wider acceptance and adoption of this technology.

In response to challenges faced by conventional wind turbines in urban landscapes, the project strategically leverages BWTs and microgrids, presenting a transformative solution 
for clean energy production in urban settings. The goal is to harness wind energy potential in Boston and contribute significantly to the city's electricity requirements. The 
innovative nature of this project lies in its ability to provide a self-sustaining, clean energy source with minimal impact on the visual landscape, thus redefining the 
possibilities of urban wind energy.
